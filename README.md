You are required to use JavaScript to confirm that the user has filled in all of these fields.  Simply check that the name and phone fields are not empty and that the email address contains the @ symbol.  When the form is submitted, the fields should be checked and a red highlight should appear around any incomplete fields. There should also be red text to ask the user to fill the fields as required.  
 
When the form is redisplayed, we want to ensure that the correct data is kept. Use Ajax to ensure that only the “invalid” data is highlighted in red and that the rest of the fields are maintained as the user filled them.  
 
When the form is filled properly display a “thank you” message below the form.
